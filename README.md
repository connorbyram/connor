As a web developer with a background in psychology, I bring a unique perspective to every project. I am a creative problem-solver who values collaboration and utilizing my diverse skill set to create web solutions that drive results. By combining my technical expertise with my understanding of human behavior, I deliver intuitive and engaging user experiences.

I am also a lifelong learner and maker, constantly seeking new experiences to enhance my creativity. My passions range from woodworking and furniture design, guitar pedals, dialing in my morning cup of coffee, tackling challenging rock climbing routes, to exploring new destinations through travel. I believe having diverse hobbies outside of my career allows me to access new ways of thinking and solving problems.
